Please create a project folder under ML4T directory as other projects did, then place all the .py files inside the project folder and make sure util.py is under the ML4T directory and one directory up from the project folder.

Each .py file can be run by using “PYTHONPATH=../:. python __.py” command.

indicators.py will show all the graphs and nothing else.

ManualStrategy.py BestPossibleStrategy.py and ComparetiveAnalysis.py will show graphs first then print out all the performance data after closing the graphs.
